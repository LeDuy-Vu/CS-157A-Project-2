# CS-157A-Project-2-Data-Design
As a team of 2, we developed a relational database design for a hypothetical company selling homeowners insurance based on raw data about the company's operations and their customers. From scratch, we followed planned steps to transfer original ideas to preliminary ER diagram, convert it to relational database schemas, and normalize to get the final design. We also created a small sample data set to test the design in SQLite and successfully provided the company desired data from 100% of their business queries.<br/>
My gratitude to my teammate Yuta Kihara for such productive and delightful working time.
